Hello Robin!

I was wondering if you'd be interested in helping us out at the community center next Sunday? We're having a new pinball machine arriving tomorrow and since you're the OG pinball wizard...

Sam, good to hear from you. That sounds really funky! Yeah, I'm in. What time were you thinking?

Robin, we're starting to set up around 9am and open at 10:30. You can park in the employee parking lot as usual if you want.
We've got cookies and beer!
Gimme a ring in case anything happens, otherwise I'll see you on Sunday morning.
